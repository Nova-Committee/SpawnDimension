# Spawn Dimension

This is a fork of the Safe Nether Spawn mod, modified to be compatible with any existing dimensions.

The spawn dimension is defined via the config (`spawn_dimension.toml`), with an extra option to specify whether the game will be forced to respawn the player in the spawn dimension.
